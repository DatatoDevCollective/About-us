# Data-to-Dev Collective

Data-to-Dev Collective aims to build open source tools
useful for urban, environmental and civic geospatial innovations. Our work builds on collaborations with the open source community globally and contributes back into the community by becoming a seed for innovation in the space.

## Vision/Mission
We are on a mission to
raise the bar of open source civic tech globally and promote innovation.
(I want to work on narrowing this.)

## Our Approach
- Open source
- Collaborative
- Run on organisation/individuals sponsorship/donations (do we apply for grants? - yes or VC funds? - Up for Discussion)
- We are a Collective -

  (Long term-
  we have a core member team for each chapter.
  We can have several contributors.

  For now-
  build a core member team.)
- Primary purpose to be democratic - i.e. we can do polls once we reach a certain audience in deciding the project/innovation direction eg. which tools to build etc. It will be a balancing act in the end.

- Secondary to offer services - We can work in collaboration with other organisations -NGO/ govt bodies to develop solutions for their specific challenge. - ie we can accept payments from them in return to our service (in addition to usual donation channel) but we make it open source.

- Website: use to maintain what we are working on, what's happening in the community, guide for contributions, details on our chapter and core team members growth (put out posts for welcoming people to join - looking for driven people):

### Financial Research
  - Financial models for open source funding - https://itsfoss.com/open-source-funding-platforms/ (Up for discussion)
    * [FOSS United](https://fossunited.org/grants) provides grants for FOSS projects in India. Can be an avenue to look at.
    * A [guide](https://opensource.guide/getting-paid/) to getting paid for open source work.
    * A [list](https://opensource.com/resources/organizations) of organizations potentially funding open source projects.
    * A [list](https://guide.opentech.fund/appendix-iv-alternative-sources-of-support#coding-and-software-development) of grant opportunities for sofware development.
    * [Grant opportunity](https://ocean.sagepub.com/concept-grants/) to write software packages for social scientists.
    * A github [doc](https://github.com/ralphtheninja/open-funding) on funding for open source projects.
    *  [R consortium Grants](https://www.r-consortium.org/projects/awarded-projects)

## Secret to our Success
- Building useful tools, being strategic about it initially.
- Networking with like minded people/orgs, letting people know of our presence - what we do, how we can be useful,
- Maintaining open communication with the people who use our tools, keeping them invovled with us.
